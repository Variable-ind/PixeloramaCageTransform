# PixeloramaCageTransform

An extension that adds a functional (albeit unrefined) bezier curve cage transform tool for Pixelorama.

Simply make a selection on your canvas and switch to the tool to begin transforming and press Enter to commit the transform.

**Note:** At the moment, the tool does not account for the strange interactions that are possible due to Pixelorama's separation of right/left mouse tools (eg. drawing or modifying the selection while the transform is in progress). For best results, do not use any other tool while the transform is active.

## Download Instructions
Download the latest .pck from Releases or clone the repository and export a .pck via Godot. Load the .pck as an extension in Pixelorama.
